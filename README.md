Set Roulette is format, or a way to play [Magic the Gathering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic:_The_Gathering). It is a constructed format where you build your deck from 6 sets which are somewhat randomly selected. A Set Roulette event often consists of rolling a random set of 6 sets, and then a deck building/brewing/playtesting 'season' ranging in length from a couple days to a couple weeks, followed by a tournament to see who brewed the strongest build.

This is a local-only webpage that rolls a random set of 6 MTG sets for you for the purposes of playing this format.
